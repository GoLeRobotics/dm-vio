CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (LIBZIP)
  does not match the name of the calling package (LibZip).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

  cmake/FindLibZip.cmake:24 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  CMakeLists.txt:30 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
