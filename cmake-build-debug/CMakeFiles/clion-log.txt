CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:4 (CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGTSAM.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTSAM" with any of
  the following names:

    GTSAMConfig.cmake
    gtsam-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GTSAM" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GTSAM_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GTSAM"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
